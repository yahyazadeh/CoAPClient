# CoAPClient
This is a JavaFX-based application intended to send a CoAP packet from client to a server and receive the corresponding CoAP packet from the server.
Using the application, a user is able to generate an arbitrary CoAP packet and send it to a server to investigate the server's response.

CoAP client is developed in GUI-based and command line-based version. Both versions are able to send either a specific message determined by a user or a randomized message.
